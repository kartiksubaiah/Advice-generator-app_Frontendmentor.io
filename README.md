### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap
- Javascript

### Continued development

-I used Bootstrap thinking it would be way easier than vanilla, however I faced the challenge of trying to change the column width class for mobile phone view using media query.
But anyways it was achieved by changing the width prperty in the media query.
-I also faced the challenge of having the dice icon moving along the bottom edge of the container as the container changed the size as per the quote length. It was achieved using the position: Relative property for the container. The position property is something which I have to spend a little more time on to understand.
